    <h1>UI.JS</h1>
    <p>The web's simplest UI framework.</p>

    <h2>ui.js is different</h2>
    <p>
        With so many Javascript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, it can be
        challenging to make a simple website quickly, with little dependencies. Many
        of the leading frameworks require Node.js and other tools that make projects
        bloated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why are we dependant on a frameworks that require so much overhead just to get
        us a way to build declarative UI's. What if we stopped using React and Angular
        and went back to simple html, css, and javascript environment? Well, with
        <em>ui.js</em> you can.
    </p>
    <p>
        ui.js is a small library, only <span id="line-count">...</span> lines long.
    </p>
    <p>
        ui.js achieves this by relying mostly on vanilla JS principles, plus (and this is important)
        a declarative way of building the UI's which rely on the spread (...) operator. With ui.js
        you can build a declarative JS ui. Here is a simple example:
    </p>

    <div id="example-1"></div>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <h3>Using ui.js to populate an HTML element</h3>
    <p>
        In general, you want to use HTML as much as possible.
        This improves SEO, and makes your site load faster. In general you can make a html element
        and then use <code>ui.root(queryString)</code> to use JS to create it's children.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you have an html element like
        <code>(example html code)</code> then you can do
        the following.
    </p>

    <div id="example-2"></div>

    <p>
        <em>Eventual I may add functionality here that make the developer write even less code</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        While I think it is really useful to embed values created by JS into html this way, you can
        also use this same approach if you want to build a single paged application.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying lists of Data</h3>
    <p>
        Often times, you have an api that will return a list for items. With ui.js it
        very easy to show each item to the user, here is an example:
    </p>

    <div id="example-3"></div>

    <p>Of course, with a little more effort we can make the list much more dynamic.</p>

    <div id="example-4"></div>

    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p>Forms are also easy to implement, see the following example:</p>

    <div id="example-5"></div>

    <h3>Custom Components</h3>
    <p>
        By now, you have seen some custom components already in use. See <code>customForm</code> function from the
        "Forms" code example.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main reason you would want to create a custom component would be to
        manage the state of each component at the component level. For example,
        the following code show how to create two counter buttons with their own
        counts using a custom component
    </p>

    <div id="example-6"></div>

    <h4>Anonymous Components</h4>

    <p>
        Sometimes its convenient to just create the component inline, this comes in handy
        when you just need some simple state management.
    </p>

    <div id="example-7"></div>

    <p>
        Custom components are key because they allow your code to be reusable, simplified,
        and stateful. When you use a custom component, all of the "state" the variables you
        are using to keep track of data remain local.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, remember that just updating a components state will not automatically "rerender"
        that component, You need to explicitly decided how the component gets rendered. In the above
        example, you can see that we used a custom component <code>content</code> that was called every
        time we wanted to show the user how many times they clicked on the button. Every time the user clicked
        on the button we had to update the buttons children to show the new state.
    </p>

    <h3>Communicating Across Components</h3>

    <p>
        You may want to have an action taken in one component that would effect the state of a completely
        different component. You can do this with <code>ui.publisher()</code>
    </p>

    <p> 
        <code>ui.publisher</code> creates an object with 2 methods, <code>publish</code> which emits an event and 
        <code>addSubscriber</code> which allows a different component to receive the event. 
    </p>
